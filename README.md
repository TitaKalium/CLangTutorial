A sorta informative way to learn C

In order to efficiently learn C, start in levels. There are no quizzes, so just do what you can. 

Start off with Level 1. This is the beginner level. 

## How to run
To run, just run it normally in VSCode. Easier that way :D

## Credits
Thanks to W3 Schools for helping me out with the information to learn C.
