// You always start off your C project with the following
// You always require #include <stdio.h> in your libraries for all of the basic functions to properly work. 
#include <stdio.h>

// You also need to define a function in this case:
int main(){
    // To print something, you need to use printf(), and then add whatever you need to
    printf("Hello World!");
    //To end off the function, add return 0;
    return 0;
}       //Keep in mind that all of the content inside of int main() ends with a semicolon (;). 
        //You need that to end a phrase. There are exceptions, though we will go over this.
